After using finite mixture modeling to [cluster the neighborhoods (ZATs)](../ZAT_profile/ZAT_profile.qmd) across all the ZAT-level indicators on road infrastructures, we'll visualize the resulting neighborhood profiles on maps.

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
```

## Data preparation

As mentioned in the previous post, all ZAT-level indicators were categorized into two domains, street design and transportation, and the neighborhood profiles are generated for each ZAT unit from the Gaussian mixture model-based clustering across the variables in each domain, as well as in both domains together. From the modeling results, we could extract the domain-specific and overall cluster information of all ZATs with `clusters()`, and join the data with the ZAT-level shapefiles in `ZAT folder` to get the geometry.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
zat_cluster <- zat_std2 %>% 
  select(ZAT) %>% 
  mutate(all = clusters(all_mix_c),
         street = clusters(st_mix_c),
         transp = clusters(tp_mix_c)) %>% 
  left_join(zat, by = "ZAT") %>% 
  select(ZAT, all, street, transp, geometry) %>% 
  st_as_sf()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
zat_cluster <- readRDS("../../../../clean_data/zat_cluster.rds")
```

## Mapping the profiles

To spatially visualize the neighborhood profiles, we'll create 3 maps to plot the cluster assignment of each ZAT unit for street design domain, transportation domain and both domains together.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
street <- zat_cluster %>%
  select(ZAT, geometry, street) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  #using NAD83 in tmap
  tm_shape(projection = sf::st_crs(26915))+
  tm_polygons("street",
    palette = "YlGn",
    style = "cat",
    title = "cluster")+
  tm_layout(panel.show = TRUE,
    panel.labels = "Street Design Profiles",
    panel.label.fontface = "bold",
    title.position = c("left", "TOP"),
    legend.position = c("RIGHT", "bottom"),
    legend.title.size = 0.9,
    legend.width = 2)

transp <- zat_cluster %>%
  select(ZAT, geometry, transp) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  #using NAD83 in tmap
  tm_shape(projection = sf::st_crs(26915))+
  tm_polygons("transp",
    palette = "YlGn", 
    style = "cat",
    title = "cluster")+
  tm_layout(panel.show = TRUE,
    panel.labels = "Transportation Profiles",
    panel.label.fontface = "bold",
    title.position = c("left", "TOP"),
    legend.position = c("RIGHT", "bottom"),
    legend.title.size = 0.9,
    legend.width = 2)

all_ind <- zat_cluster %>%
  select(ZAT, geometry, all) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  #using NAD83 in tmap
  tm_shape(projection = sf::st_crs(26915))+
  tm_polygons("all",
    palette = "YlGn", 
    style = "cat",
    title = "cluster")+
  tm_layout(panel.show = TRUE,
    panel.labels = "All-Indicator Profiles",
    panel.label.fontface = "bold",
    title.position = c("left", "TOP"),
    legend.position = c("RIGHT", "bottom"),
    legend.title.size = 0.9,
    legend.width = 2)

plots <- list(street, transp, all_ind)
  
current.mode <- tmap_mode("plot")

tmap_arrange(
    plots,
    nrow = 1,
    width = c(0.34, 0.33, 0.33)
  )
```

We can see that the clustering by street design and/or transportation domain(s) yielded a relatively consistent pattern of neighborhood profiles in Bogotá.
