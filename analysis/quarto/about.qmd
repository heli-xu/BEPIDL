Welcome! I'm Heli, a data analyst at Drexel Urban Health Collaborative, and this is home of the notes from **Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study**, a project led by Dr. Alex Quistberg and funded by NIH. You can find out more about the project on the [NIH website](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10692708).
