# BEPIDL

Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study, a project led by Dr. Alex Quistberg at Drexel Urban Health Collaborative and funded by NIH, aims to use deep learning with image data to create a database of built environment features in Bogot√°, Colombia and assess their association with pedestrian injuries and social environment status. You can find out more about the project on the [NIH website](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10692708).

I'm a data analyst working with Dr. Quistberg, and this repo is for documenting my journey with the project.
